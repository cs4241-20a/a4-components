Assignment 4 - Components

## Developer Ice Cream

https://a4-ahjicha.herokuapp.com/

My assignment 4 has the same functionality as my assignment 3, but with svelte. The user can log in with their github account, 
view their orders, create orders, delete orders, and update the flavor of their orders. They can also view others' orders but cannot
make any changes to them. 

In terms of minor changes, it is now very obvious that the flavor field can be updated (it appears as a text input). The website also
has slightly different styling, due to differences in how milligram treated the code from svelte.

I felt that svelte helped the development experience. It made the process of parsing and using the values from the json and html more streamlined because the entire process on the client side took place in one file (app.svelte). This was only really a significant change for updating purposes, but it still was useful. I think I would like to learn more about svelte in the future, because I think it would be more interesting if I had more than one component (and therefore more than one svelte file).
