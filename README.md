# To Do List

The goal of this application is for users to be able to log into the website using Github, 
and have their credentials stored in a database so they can save their tasks. 
Users are able to add, edit, and delete to-do list items.

# Changes
 
The biggest change in this application is using ReactJS. The new technology seems seamless to use, 
however there was some challenges in implementing it into my existing code for the project. It was very difficult
in getting my server to work as well as my github authorization. I think it would've been easier to code the program from
scratch in ReactJS, but I see myself using ReactJS more in the future.
