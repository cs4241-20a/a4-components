Assignment 4 - Components

I tried to implement my application in the same way I did for project 3, however, I had multiple difficulties with react, first, I could not use react-create-app in glitch since it would immediately fill the free disk space for glitch. Instead of working on it in glitch, I just developed it locally and used localhost to test it. The second problem I had was that when I changed from the login page to the schedule page, the login page does not go away even when using history.replace. Finally, I was able to get the project onto glitch after I completed it, however, it was using too much CPU for the free version, and constantly has to close because it is using too much memory. It eventually stopped restarting, but the code was not working the same in glitch as in the localhost, it seems like the component is rendering, but not communicating with my server.js even though this worked locally.

All in all I would definitely prefer not using react since it seems inconvenient and bloated, while not making the code any simpler.
