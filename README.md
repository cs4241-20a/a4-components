Include a very brief summary of your project here and what you changed / added to assignment #3. Briefly (3â€“4 sentences) answer the following question: did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?
Project: track your runs. I changed style a bit. Made the components reactive. Tried to make the layout responsive (but didn't 100% succeed).
 
The technology definitely improved the development process. React allows to have a much better app structure and allows to scale better and easier + have access to a lot of existing libraries.
