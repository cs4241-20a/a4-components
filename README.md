## Raymond's Initiative Tracker (React version)

https://a4-raymond-dolan.herokuapp.com/

This project is a simple intiative tracker for DnD or a similar TTRPG. The only real changes to this project were changing it to use React. It was a little bit of a struggle because it was challenging for me to find out exactly how to create an application with a server, as React apps I've made in the past have just used an AWS api. It took me a little bit longer to convert it to React than it did to write originally. I do like the components of React, as they let me condense the content into seperate components.
