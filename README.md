TaskBuddy is a To-do list that allows users to organize their schedules by adding tasks they need to complete, along with a priority of when to complete it by. The app then provides users with an estimate of the amount of the time they have left to work on the task, based on the priority. 

### Changes from A3 and additions 
For assignment A4, I recreated and built upon my ToDo application from A3 using React. The project is implemented using hosting service, Heroku. All the changes for this project were made to the index HTML file. The login and home pages were altered to use React components. Overall, I had a positive experience with using React and definitely realised its potential to make development quick and easy. However, since I had to go back to my assignment A3 and recreate it with React, there were a lot of small syntax changes that made the process tedious and took adjusting. Looking back, starting the project using React would have definitely sped up the development process and made it much cleaner and simple. A great example of simplification with React, was the ability to add an onClick listener for buttons right next to them in the HTML, instead of in a seperate Window.onLoad function.
