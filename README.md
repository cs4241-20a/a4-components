## Flash Card App in React

https://a4-alan-curiel.herokuapp.com/

I recreated Assignment 3 in react from the client. It was easier to do conceptually, meaning if I had started with react it would have been easier. But for this App I had to remake the front end in a different manner. I also wish I could have used the functional React rather than the class form. No new changes to the app. it uses the database from the A3 so you can go back and forth.
