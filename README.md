This app is still a generic todo list, with a simple style. You can only add, edit
and delete. No looking back, get that task over with and move on!

**Changes from A3**:
The app now uses React for its main page instead of the more cumbersome simple js/jquerry/html
from before. The use of react initially was very confusing, setting it up didn't go as planned
and it took a while to figure out what exactly I needed to do to even start using it. It turned
out to be very simple, thanks to React's official "Add React to a Website" tutorial. In the end,
I can see clearly how using react makes desiging and maintaining interfaces much easier thanks to 
its modularity and ability to contain each thing in its own file.
