## ToDo List App

Hosted on Glitch https://a4-zhecheng-song.glitch.me/

I implemented React as client side (in script.jsx) and adjust the HTML file (adjust layout, adding React reference) for it.

React makes each part of html a movable piece, which makes it easy to re-use and edit different parts. However, it's harder to get a reference to a sinlge part. This makes manipulating a mutable list really hard.
