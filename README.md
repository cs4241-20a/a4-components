For this assignment you will re-implement the client side portion of A3 using either React or Svelte components.

This project can be implemented on any hosting service (Glitch, DigitalOcean, Heroku etc.), however, you must include all files in your GitHub repo so that the course staff can view them; these files are not available for viewing in many hosting systems.
