## Shopping List
Basic grocery list app where users can add, modify, and delete grocery items.
I recreated the front-end using React. To do this, I added in the files App.js, App.css, and Login.js based on the previous login/homepage modified to use React components. The file index.js was used to insert the React component. I modified the index.html file as well. 

Overall I think using React improved the development experience because I was able to automatically update the list based on its "state" rather than having to continuously add to an array and append elements. The only part that was confusing was understanding the lifecycle of React itself and being able to implement it with the previous assignment code.
