## TODO - Task Management Application

https://a4-hunter-trautz.herokuapp.com/

- I created a simple TODO application which allows you to make an account and create new individual tasks that have a name, description, priority, and due date.
- After being authenticated on the application's login page users are then redirected to the homepage
- Due dates are automatically generated for each task based on the priority that was entered and you are able to delete tasks by pressing the 'Delete' button associated with it.
- Tasks can be updated by entering new information in the input fields and then pressing the update button next to the task you want to update
- Utilized flexboxes to ensure that the UI of the application scales to the user's web browser
- Tasks are stored on a MongoDB instead of on local machine
- Tasks are now associated with user accounts which are also stored on MongoDB
- Login with GitHub supported
