## Golf Club Tracker v3

http://a4-matt-tolbert.glitch.me

I changed this slightly from assignment 3 in that I removed the automatic sorting of golf clubs by distance and the local list. I removed this local list in order to be able to most effectively take advantage of Svelte's ability to automatically update a list from a promise. I found that using Svelte severely hindered me as using multiple pages became much more complex than it is using server issued redirects. Furthermore, the code to update nodes currently adds a new item upon submission instead of editing the current one (despite the endpoint handling this logic being nearly identical to last week). The add and delete functionality works perfectly, despite some weird issues with the page sometimes needing to be refreshed. Overall, I felt that it was extremely complex to try to rework working code into Svelte rather than starting from scratch and building around its perks rather than trying to redesign existing code to fit with it. Given the vague nature of the assignment, I feel that I did successfully implement and experiment thoroughly with Svelte and I look forward to using it more in the future.
