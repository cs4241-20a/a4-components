## Project Manager With Svelte

My project is a project manager which gives users access to upload project entries and see what how they should handle completing them. The WebApp shows a priority which is based off the time left to complete the project. I changed how to project is viewed, opting to keep it one page instead of navigating to another page for the application or login.

The new technology helped in making my project much more modular or organized. Despite not changing anything for this aspect of the project, I think svelte allows for more focus on design because it was a lot easier to put the backend together like my javascript and server functions. This is something that I would definitely see myself using in the future with other projects.
