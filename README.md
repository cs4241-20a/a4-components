This project remains the same as the previous iteration and functions as a playoff bracket picker. Much of the functionality remains the same and the implementations for them are similar but using react. It was somewhat difficult to change over my application to react because the switch exposed some weaknesses in my implementation that i had to remedy. Overall the switch to react made my code rely less upon practices that I now know to be unideal. I think I will use react in future because it will facilitate better coding practices.
