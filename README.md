I used React to recreate my A3 project and hosted it on heroku. The app is a to-do list application that enables the user to create, edit, complete, and view the auto-generated deadline. I found React made styling and front-end development to be slightly more tedious while I was originally learning how to use it, but quickly realized it offered many more features and significantly reduced the lines of code required overall. Overall, I would say it definitely helped development and it was interesting to experiment with.
