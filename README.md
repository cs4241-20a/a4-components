Include a very brief summary of your project here and what you changed / added to assignment #3. Briefly (3â€“4 sentences) answer the following question: did the new technology improve or hinder the development experience?

For this project, I decided to reimplement my frontend using React components. While looking over available component based solutions, I found Svelte rather intriguing, but in the end I opted to do React due to the high demand for this technology. At first, I was running into difficulties getting components to load - this was resolved once I read about the importance of preprocessors and most issues were resolved after that. Compared to writing pure JS and HTML, I certainly preferred the component based approach. Creating classes and encapsulating functionality in that felt very natural compared to the relative freeness of creating script files that are loaded alongside HTML. Also, encapsulating website elements inside components greatly simplified the HTML and provided a much cleaner appearance to my webpages - the HTML was no longer cluttered cascading tags and indents. Should I create more websites, I will definitely consider using components again.
