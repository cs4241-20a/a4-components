## Shared Bar Database: React Attempt
https://rhbirchfield-a3-persistance.herokuapp.com/

I changed very little overall. I ran across significant obstacles when it came to doing React development, that due to my late submission time I was unable to resolve. The goal was to have the form and table of the database be implemented using react, but I could not figure out how to do it. I believe that if I were to recreate the app starting in react, I would be able to complete it, but due to having to transision from regular to react, I could not figure it out. For this reason I believe that React added many more obstacles for my app than it could have resolved.
