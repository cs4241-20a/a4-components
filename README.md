For this project I rewrote the frontend of A3 using React. This was my first time really using a frontend framework for a non-trivial project.
It was definitely a bit cumbersome at first and I didn't really see a ton of benefits on this project but I can see how useful it would be for very
large-scale projects. State management in React took me a while to get the hang of but is ultimately very useful. I ran into some issues with routing
and authentication especially when using the development server provided by create-react-app. I had to make some pretty hacky fixes that would have
required re-writing a large portion of the backend to implement properly. Heroku also gave me some trouble with installing client dependencies and
building the React application when on deployment. I ended up figuring it out and learned a lot working on this project. I will definitely be experimenting
more with React and other frontend frameworks for future projects.
