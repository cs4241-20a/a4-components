## A4 Virtual Shopping List in React

Website link: https://a4-ryan-cirella.herokuapp.com/

The goal of my application is to hold a list of items for a grocery store shopping list, but this time creating it with React!

From project 3, the page is now a single page app instead of two pages. This would eliminate any load times for users. With the use of components for the login and list page I was able to abstract a lot of the functionality of the app.

Using React was a great learning experience to see how many websites are made today. Once I got the hang of how components worked, my development experience was improved. Although there were certain points where learning new things about navigation, serving pages and making specific components slowed development. Working on another React app in the future would go much faster because of what I learned.

Once again, here is the usage for the app.
*Usage:*
- To login, enter a username and password to the fields. (Already created is Username: testuser Password: 22)
- If you do not have an account, enter a username and password and click 'Create Account'. The account will be created and you will be logged in automatically.

- Once logged in...
- To add an item, enter it in the input box and click "Add Item"
- To remove an item, make sure the input box is blank and click on the item in the list
- To edit an item, enter the new value in the input box and click on the item to edit in the list

- To logout, click the Logout button and there will be a text indication showing that you are now logged out.

## Technical Achievements
- Moved the website to a React framework.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- Kept the css from the previous project entact on this one.
