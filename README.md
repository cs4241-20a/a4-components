## Game High Scores 3.0 (React)

The goal of my application was to create a system that allowed users to sign in via Github and input scores they got in a certain video game, which would be stored in a database. Users can also view, edit, and delete their results from the database using a table on the page.

For this assignment, I re-implemented the front end of my previous project using React. Overall, I thought that React was significantly easier to use because of the state property. This allowed me to easily keep track of user inputted data. I was also able to implement the edit and delete functionality this time around because onClick listeners are much simpler in React and do not require as much setup.
