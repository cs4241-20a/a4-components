### Project Description

This application allows a user to save the details of cars they are interested in purchasing in the future. The user can add, delete, and modify the car entries that belong to their profile. Along with using a simple login functionality, the app also provides the user the ability to log in using Github OAuth.  

### Changes

All the changes to my application were made within my HTML and JS files. I utilized React for these changes.

- HTML
    - Login/Home: Holds a div container for the React components
- JS
    - Login: 
        - Modified to use React components
    - Home: 
        - Modified to use React components
        - Changed the manner I updated my table - this was highly simplified by using React

### Reflection
Due to the fact that I refactored the way my table updated, I felt that for at least this assignment it hindered my development experience. However, I believe that going forward the React components would definitely help speed up my development process. I thought the components were fairly intuitive to use compared to how I had previously been orchastrating the UI changes of my application.
