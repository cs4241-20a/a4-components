## React Package Delivery Application

This project was implemented using Glitch. <br>
Hosting Link: https://a4-lindberg-simpson.glitch.me <br>

I had a lot of trouble trying to convert the original project into React. <br>
There were several node errors that I couldnt resolve so eventually I tried to implement React a different way. <br>
I started with my a3 base then followed this guide by react: https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html 
to incorporate it into my a3 project. <br> <br>
Overall the new technology hindered the process because of all the errors and issues I had trying to host it on glitch, but I could see React being very useful for projects I do in the future.
