Assignment 4:
I made a simple to-do list with Svelte based on my A4 assignment.
I was successful in implementing mongoDB as my database and adding items to my list
but I had issues deleting and editing items. I have code for the modify and 
delete functionality, but nothing I seemed to do would make them work 
properly. From assignment 3, the edit and delete buttons no longer work,
and the login page is not displaying. The add feature adds items reactively
to the list. I believe the new technology (Svelte in this case) actually
hindered my coding performance in this case. It had a different type of 
functionality than I was intuitively used to. I believe there can be many 
benefits from reactive programming, but I will need time to learn more
about how to go about inmplementing it.
