Party Guest List
---

This project is an attempt to make a comprehensive guest list for party events. It is meant to streamline the process of both adding and verifying whether the guest is of legal drinking age, while also maintaining a log of their birthday (in case errors arise) and their gender. This uses a persistent database in the backend to keep track of guests and the author of the guest, that way a particular users guest only shows up for them. There are also a handful of middleware packages to simplify and secure the application.

## Changes
The biggest change made between this assignment and the last assignment was the use of <a href="reactjs.org">ReactJS</a>. This technology helped immensely in terms
of compartmentalizing all of the various parts of my application. It also helped make the HTML much more readable in my opinion. Whereas I would have to spend a lot of 
time looking through the HTML code to find a single part, it is now easier to look at a smaller snippet as a component.
I also found it helpful as I had a component that was repeated throughout multiple pages and being able to reuse that code made things so much easier.
I only had one issue where the JS would start before the components would load even though the HTML would technically be loaded, but this was an easy fix thanks to the
comprehensive documentation. Overall I see myself using this more in the future.
