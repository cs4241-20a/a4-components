## A4-Dev-Patel

I used React to recreate my A3 project and was able to host it on heroku. I created a homework to-do list which allows users to add homeworks, edit, and delete them. The user can also login in using Github Oauth. At first I found React annoying and tedious since I had to refactor a lot of my code, but near the end I was getting used to it and could definetly see how there were less lines of code written but the same product. I believe that if I use it next time, it will be much easier to navigate through it. The changes I made were mainly moving everything from javascript file to the html, and modified it to use the react components.
